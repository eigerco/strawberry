## Introduction

Strawberry is an implementation of the JAM (JOIN-ACCUMULATE MACHINE) client for Polkadot, developed in Go. This implementation aims to provide a lightweight, performant, and secure JAM client.

For more information about JAM, read the [graypaper](https://graypaper.com).
Strawberry follows the specifications outlined in version [0.4.5](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/releases/tag/v0.4.5).

## Features

- Written in Go for performance and reliability
- Currently implementing M1 IMPORTER: State-transitioning conformance tests pass and can import blocks.
- Easy to configure and extend

## Installation

To install Strawberry, ensure you have Go installed on your system. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eigerco/strawberry.git
    cd strawberry
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
   make build 
    ```

3. Run the demo executable:
    ```bash
    ./strawberry
    ```
## Usage
This demo app starts up a simple http server with one endpoint.
The import block endpoint can be accessed at `POST /block/import`

Usage example:
```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/block/import -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@demo-block-sample.json"
```

This returns:
```
{"message":"extrinsic guarantees validation failed, err: anchor block not present within recent blocks","status":"error"}
```
Meaning that the block is being validated.

## Run tests

### Unit tests

```shell
make test
```

### Integration tests
Integration tests validate our code using the test vectors provided by [this](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors) repository.
All integration tests are grouped within the `tests/integrations` folder, and the test cases/vectors (JSON and BIN files) are located in the `tests/integration/vectors` directory.
To execute these tests, use the following command:
```shell
make integration
```
